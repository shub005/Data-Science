## -----------Working on Time Series Data--------
help("economics")

# Lines are typically used to plot trends over time
# We will use the economics data frame (in-built in R)
# Economics frame contains 6 variables of US economics:
# Date, personal savings rate, personal expenditure, no of unemployed,
# median duration of unemployment and total US population

# Print out head of economics
head(economics)

# Plot unemploy as a function of date using a line plot
# Note the steep dip at 2008 - That is teh infamous recession
# And that peak at 2010 when the economy recovered again..
ggplot(economics,aes(x=date,y=unemploy))+geom_line()

# Adjust the plot to represent the fraction of total population that is unemployed
# Fraction of unemployed is a better to judge the economy, don't you agree?
ggplot(economics,aes(x=date,y=unemploy/pop))+geom_line()

# Mapping color to average savings rate: Trend is difficult to observe using this plot
# The colour variation (savings rate) is barely noticeable
ggplot(economics,aes(x=date,y=unemploy/pop,col=psavert))+geom_line()

# To observe how savings rate affects the economy, we need to see color better 
# Add points along with line for better readability
# Just add a geom_point layer to the geom_line 
ggplot(economics,aes(x=date,y=unemploy/pop,col=psavert))+geom_line()+geom_point()

# --Observations from the plot---

# It's more readable now: The dark blue regions are periods when people saved less money, 
# light blue means they saved more 
# Personal savings started dropping steeply just before 2000 and 2008
# And these were the two recession periods. When people save less, the economy is in danger
# This plot, if made in 2007, could have saved the world from a disaster, right? 

## -----------Observing recent unemployment ----------

# Next, let's observe only the recent unemployment rate
# Say you want to know only the trend after 1st Jan 2013
recent<-economics[economics$date>as.Date("2013-01-01"),]

# We can create a smaller data frame called recent and plot unemployment v/s to
# Create recent data frame with Date > January 1, 2013
# Check structure os recent data frame
srt(recent)

# Plot date on a and unemployment on y axis, use geom_line
ggplot(recent,aes(date,unemploy))+geom_line()

# Step Plot: A step plot is another variation of the geom layer
# Steps help you observe the exact time points when steep changes occur
ggplot(recent,aes(date,unemploy))+geom_step()# Can you now observe the periods when unemployment reduced rapidly?
